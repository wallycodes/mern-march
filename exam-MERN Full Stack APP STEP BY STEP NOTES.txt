-Setup forms etc

- set up a const for getters and setters with useState (import useState)
- setup the prperties of the object
- setup changehandler so we can store the info into useState
- add these handlers to form onChange={changeHandler}
- add the value of the input forms value={show.title}

- pass props in as a parameter to the 'Form' variable so we can use the form info in our App.js,
remember that info gets passed from parent to child (componmenet to App.js)





Wally, for sure!! There are so many dependencies to keep track of: 
server: mongoose, cors, express, nodemon
client: axios, react-router-dom
