-Setup forms etc

- set up a const for getters and setters with useState (import useState)
- setup the prperties of the object
- setup changehandler so we can store the info into useState
- add these handlers to form onChange={changeHandler}
- add the value of the input forms value={show.title}

- pass props in as a parameter to the 'Form' variable so we can use the form info in our App.js,
remember that info gets passed from parent to child (componmenet to App.js)

Backend
-create/copy folder structure
-change the config file, change the name of the DB, new name will create new one automatically
-change names of all files to match (make sure routes to files are changed
-change const in server.js file to new const





Wally, for sure!! There are so many dependencies to keep track of: 
server: mongoose, cors, express, nodemon
client: axios, react-router-dom
